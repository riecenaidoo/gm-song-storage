/**
 * Represents operations on a collection of entities.
 *
 * @apiNote Instances of this service should be treated as collective nouns representing their
 *     entity type. e.g.
 *     <pre>
 *   {@code private final AppleService apples;}
 * </pre>
 *
 * @implSpec The service layer of the application.
 *     <p>This package contains service contracts that represent units of work the system can
 *     perform, including queries and operations that enforce business rules.
 *     <p>Rules:
 *     <ol>
 *       <li>The service layer communicates exclusively using the common domain language. It must
 *           not service requests expressed in layer-specific dialects such as DTOs or Commands.
 *       <li>All service methods must represent meaningful operations in the domain, including both
 *           business rule–enforcing actions and query-based use cases.
 *     </ol>
 *     <p>Style:
 *     <ol>
 *       <li>Service contracts must respect the ordering of the serviced domain object's fields,
 *           particularly in method and parameter declaration order.
 *       <li>Service methods should be grouped by CRUD operations. Within each group, singular
 *           operations should be defined before batch operations.
 *     </ol>
 *     <p>These classes may be aware of other layers or technical concerns, but must not depend on
 *     them.
