/**
 * A test that verifies the interaction between one or more components.
 *
 * <p>Typically, to verify the interaction between our components and third-party libraries or
 * systems. They can also be used to test assumptions about third-party components, and fail if
 * those assumptions our system relies on fail.
 *
 * <p>An {@link IntegrationTest} can also be used to verify our components work together correctly,
 * but as far as possible prefer defining strong contracts for our components and {@link UnitTest}
 * expected behaviour against those contracts.
 *
 * <p>An {@link IntegrationTest} may still mock or stub out components as needed, and this is
 * encouraged to narrow the scope of what is under test.
 *
 * <p>The nature of these tests makes them slower, as they may need to spin up the application
 * context, or a portion thereof. They are expected to be run before merging or releasing to confirm
 * we have not regressed, and should be run anytime dependencies are updated or changed.
 *
 * @implSpec Suffix test classes with {@code IT}, which is the default pattern the Maven Failsafe
 *     plugin uses to detect integration tests for the verification cycle ({@code mvn verify}).
